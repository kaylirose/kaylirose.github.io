                    <h3>Hamilton</h3>
                    <p>Hamilton is a sassy and spunky cat that we have adopted here at the shelter. He is 10 years old and enjoys roaming around looking for trouble. Hamilton came to us when he was less than two weeks old. He almost died on our watch but we just could not allow that to happen. He may look devilish but this young fellow has a heart of gold. If you are ever in our shelter to visit, don't be afraid to give Hamilton a pat. </p>
