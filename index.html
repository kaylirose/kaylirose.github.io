<p>Favorite Sites</p>
<li><a href=http://www.mylokai.com/>Live Lokai</a></li>
<p>I like this site because of the simplistic layout. The site itself is simple and not too flashy. The way the site represents it's products is a reflection of what the company stands for. Finding your balance. Balance and uniqueness is exactly what this site represents.</p>
<li><a href=http://www.krochetkids.org/>Humane Society International</a></li>
<p>I like this site because it looks not only like a website, but also a brochure. It is very well balanced by it's photos and information regarding the site. The colors are a mix between light and dark.</p>
