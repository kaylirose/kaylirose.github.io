                    Gardens and the cultivation of plants have been around for thousands of years with the first examples dating to around 3000 years ago in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Romans were also keen gardeners and they were also aware of the medicinal properties of plants. Following on from the Romans in identifying the medicinal properties of plants were the monks. They also used the beauty of plants and flowers as a celebration of god. The first of these monastic gardens was created in the 8th century. These gardens were the pre-cursor to the physic gardens that appeared in the 16 century.BGCI's 7th International Congress on Education in Botanic Gardens, 1 - 6 November 2016, Durban, South Africa.<br>

                AT RGB's we are excited to announce that we will be continuing our yearly summer internships for those interested in pursuing a career with our company. This year we will migrate down to South Africa while exploring many different species of plants. Our facility has many programs that run from summer into the winter we are hoping to see you sometime this year! Our botanical gardens have had a changing role throughout history, beginning often as medicinal gardens for the study and cultivation of plants with healing properties and going through many phases including of course as pleasure gardens. But the fact that their collections are more or less scientific, means they are continually adapting and serving the needs of their societies in evolving ways as new challenges face those societies.</p>
